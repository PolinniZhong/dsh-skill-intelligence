# Changelog

## 0.4.0-beta.9 — 2026-09-28

- Moves the runtime model into `src/core/runtime-events.mjs` as the Normalizer and Invocation Aggregator: raw session events become a stable, citeable RuntimeEvent stream, and that stream folds into logical capability invocations. No UI is added by this change.
- Records who produced each event. `source: 'dsh'` means the host reported it; `source: 'derived'` means a named deterministic rule produced it. A derived event is only ever appended — it never rewrites or replaces the record it read, and a derivation that cannot cite a rule is not emitted.
- Derives `retry` under one named rule, `same-turn-repeat-after-failure`: an invocation repeated after the same capability identity failed earlier in the same turn. Log order decides, never timestamps, and the derived event carries both its rule name and the `retryOf` invocation it repeats.
- Aggregates invocations strictly by `invocationId`. Adjacency and timing are never used, so a request whose result was never observed stays `unresolved-request` and a result with no observed request stays `orphan-result`, rather than being completed with whichever event happened to be nearby.
- Gives every event a stable `eventId` and every invocation the `evidenceEventIds` that support it, so a later graph edge can cite real evidence instead of asserting a relationship.
- Separates a settled invocation from a followed one: `evidenceState` is `observed` only for a request plus a successful result, `partial` for a failure, `requested` for a half-observed call, and `unknown` otherwise. `success` still means only that the call settled.
- Names the model honestly where DSH cannot support the SDD's shape: a `tool/result` carries no tool name, so a result event does not assert a capability it cannot know — capability is resolved from the request that opened the invocation, and left unset when that request is not observable. The vocabulary is therefore `invocation.request` / `invocation.result` / `skill.invocation` / `retry` rather than per-capability result types.
- Defers runtime-evidence writes to the turn boundary while Skill evidence keeps its immediate durability. A settled invocation costs two normalized events, so rewriting the whole receipt on every `tool/call` and `tool/result` wrote the same growing file hundreds of times per session; runtime evidence is derived and a rebuild reproduces it from the durable session log.
- Stops truncating an over-long skill or tool name into a *different* valid name. Length is now checked before trimming, so a malformed identifier is refused instead of being recorded as an invocation that never happened.
- Bumps the receipt schema to version 7. Receipts written by 0.4.0-beta.8 upgrade in place: each paired runtime row becomes a request event plus a result event. Verified against the seven real receipts on this machine and against real session logs, where 667 of 667 invocations paired and nine retries were derived with their evidence chains intact.
- Changes no Host route, backup format, UI copy, learning data, or privacy projection. Runtime evidence remains metadata only: arguments and result content are still never read, and the verify guards now reject a change that would start reading them or that would pair invocations by adjacency.

## 0.4.0-beta.8 — 2026-09-28

- Records a user-explicit Skill load. The observer subscribed only to tool events, so a `/name` gesture — which DSH injects as a `user/message` carrying `source.kind = 'skill-invocation'` and never produces a `skill` tool call — left no trace at all. Verified against a real log: two `/character-asset-kit` loads in one session were previously invisible and now appear with their instruction fingerprint, candidate steps, and dependency signals.
- Reads the instruction body on both load paths, because DSH renders one canonical `<skill_content>` shape for the `skill` tool result and the user-explicit injection alike. A Skill loaded either way now yields the same fingerprint and candidate steps.
- Stores the published skill catalog as the Declaration baseline. DSH persists what the model was actually offered as a `user/message` with `source.kind = 'skill-catalog'` and `entries`; a live registry snapshot answers a different question and drifts once the session ends. Replacement publications supersede the previous baseline and are counted.
- Keeps every tool invocation as bounded runtime evidence instead of discarding everything that is not named `skill`. Tool, CLI, MCP and Subagent invocations already arrived on the stream and were dropped at the door, which is what left the runtime graph without raw material. Each record holds correlation and classification metadata only — arguments and result content are never read, and a verify guard rejects a change that would start reading them.
- Attributes a `user/message` to a turn and step by log order. These events record no turn or step of their own, so attribution comes from the `turn/start` / `step/start` cursor most recently seen in the same log, never from timestamps.
- Counts truncation instead of hiding it: the runtime projection keeps the 1000 most recent invocations and reports `runtimeEventOverflow`, so a bounded window is never presented as a complete run.
- Adds a Phase 0 contract test suite whose event shapes were captured from a real session log, with content synthesised so no local path or personal catalog ships in the fixture.
- Bumps the receipt schema to version 6. Receipts written earlier migrate in place: a legacy record carrying a `callId` is labelled `model-invoked` as a matter of record, and one without stays unlabelled rather than being guessed.
- Changes no Host route, backup format, UI copy, learning data, or privacy projection. The new collections are additive and derived from the durable log.

## 0.4.0-beta.7 — 2026-09-28

- Restores the Skill instruction fingerprint, candidate steps, dependency signals, and version-drift detection on DSH runtimes that read session format V4. The observer read only the released V3 `tool-result` wrapper block, but V4 lifts a tool result into a first-class `tool` message and retires that wrapper, so `resultBlock()` returned `null` for every result.
- Stops reporting a load that was never actually read. Because the failure flag was also read off that missing block, every V4 result was recorded as `loaded` with no fingerprint and no candidate steps, while the receipt still claimed a successful load. The reducer now reads both spellings, so V3 evidence stays byte-identical and V4 evidence is recovered.
- Adds a session-format contract test built from an actual V4 event captured from `session.v4.jsonl`: it asserts the V4 fixture carries no retired wrapper, that V4 and V3 yield the same fingerprint and candidate steps for the same Skill body, that V4 failure identity still comes from `message.isError` and the `error` payload, and that an unreadable V4 result stays empty instead of inventing evidence.
- Adds a verify guard so the tool-result reader cannot regress to matching only the retired V3 wrapper.
- Changes no receipt schema, stored data, Host route, backup format, privacy projection, or UI copy. Existing V3-era receipts are unaffected; V4-era receipts regain evidence on the next session rebuild.

## 0.4.0-beta.6 — 2026-09-14

- Restores Skill receipts, the process map, and My Skills history for every conversation. The Host read a live session's durable log through the removed `session.events` field, so every rebuild produced an empty receipt on DSH runtime 0.1.2-rc.1 and later.
- Reads the log through `session.snapshotEvents()` — the accessor current runtimes expose — with a fallback to the legacy `events` array, so a future rename cannot blank the views again.
- Stops a view read from erasing stored evidence: because viewing a conversation persists the rebuild result, the wrongly empty receipt also deleted that session's stored record on every open.
- Adds a Host route regression test that drives a `snapshotEvents()`-only session, and a verify guard against reintroducing the removed field.
- Changes no receipt evidence, local learning data, backup contents, Host API, or persistence format.

## 0.4.0-beta.5 — 2026-08-28

- Makes the client stylesheet hot-reload safe: each new client instance atomically replaces the prior style node and only removes the style it still owns.
- Prevents an older plugin instance from stripping styles after a newer instance has mounted, which previously left receipt content rendered with browser-default controls and exposed SVG markers.
- Changes no receipt evidence, local learning data, backup contents, Host API, or persistence behavior.

## 0.4.0-beta.4 — 2026-08-28

- Distills the My Skills no-selection guide to one value statement, the existing seven-step path, and one consolidated evidence boundary.
- Removes repeated outcome summaries, eyebrow copy, boxed footer instructions, and the redundant review-workspace annotation without changing navigation or stored data.
- Keeps the evidence-to-learning sequence, DSH locale switching, verified-receipt entry point, and narrow-layout behavior intact.

## 0.4.0-beta.3 — 2026-08-28

- Replaces the unverifiable WebView Blob download with Host-owned, atomically written and read-back-verified local backup files.
- Adds backup history, exact file metadata, an OS-level “open backup folder” action, restore preview, and missing-only restore that does not overwrite an existing same-session receipt.
- Handles an active session recreating trace evidence after clear-all by supplementing only missing backed-up personal records; existing user content remains authoritative, and full restores, supplemented receipts, and unchanged receipts are reported separately.
- Serializes restore with live writes per Session, blocks new writes behind a clear-all maintenance barrier, and gives each atomic receipt write a unique temporary path to prevent concurrent rename collisions.
- Replaces the empty My Skills detail pane with a bilingual seven-step evidence-to-learning guide that uses no sample receipt, model call, or new stored data.
- Creates and verifies a safety backup before clear-all or single-receipt deletion; backup failure aborts the destructive action.
- Adds explicit saved/unsaved feedback for learning notes and continuation assessments, plus correctable output references with remove confirmation.
- Keeps bounded unsaved learning, validation, and output-reference drafts in session storage across in-app view unmounts, restores only drafts based on the same saved record revision, and warns before Desktop reload or close.
- Keeps backup contents bounded to the existing receipt privacy projection and adds no cloud, upload, telemetry, Skill-body, Prompt, conversation, credential, or project-file storage.

## 0.4.0-beta.2 — Unreleased

> Release blocked: Desktop testing reproduced a false-success state for the Blob-based backup download, and the candidate has no restore path. Do not publish this candidate as a completed local-data loop.

- Turns My Skills into a local review workspace with pending-review priority, local full-text search across user-authored learning and validation fields, and explicit sorting.
- Adds a deterministic continuation handoff card that copies only receipt identity metadata, candidate steps, the user's own notes and validation result, and the user's `manual` / `partial` / `blocked` assessment.
- Adds a bounded local archive payload and an inline-confirmed clear-all action for Skill Trace receipts; the archive payload remains local, but its current Desktop download handoff is not accepted as a completed backup.
- Gives the My Skills sidebar more working width, keeps review labels readable, and stacks local-data actions so destructive copy does not wrap or drift at narrow widths.
- Replaces the remaining native receipt-delete confirmation with an in-page confirmation state.
- Keeps Skill bodies, prompts, project content, cloud sync, automated reminders, AI summaries, scoring, ranking, installation, routing, mutation, and publication out of scope.

## 0.4.0-beta.1 — Unreleased

- Adds a human-authored validation result to an original per-session Skill receipt: expectation status, observed outcome, and optional next action.
- Adds My Skills filters for pending review and recorded validation results, plus a chronological per-Skill learning and validation timeline.
- Keeps exact and candidate history associations separate and does not synthesize a cross-session “correct understanding.”
- Stores no Skill body, project content, cloud data, telemetry, score, ranking, or automatic recommendation.

## 0.3.0-beta.2 — Unreleased

- Follows the DeepSeek Harness `zh` / `en` interface-language setting, including dynamic Inspector and My Skills copy, and refreshes the Skill Trace UI in place when the setting changes.
- Centers the fixed 1000px flow-map scene inside a wide grid viewport while preserving horizontal scrolling on narrower viewports.
- Changes presentation only; receipt evidence, persisted data, Skill declarations, and user-authored notes remain untouched.

## 0.3.0-beta.1 — 2026-08-27

First public engineering preview.

- Observes DSH `skill(name)` call/result evidence and records multiple Skill loads in a session.
- Provides the Skill receipt and flow-map reading modes, including a concise session summary.
- Adds the read-only "My Skills" catalog and local per-Skill understanding, improvement, and validation notes.
- Keeps a strict distinction between a successful load, actual instruction following, output correctness, and user-confirmed usefulness.
- Adds public source-installation, architecture, privacy, and security documentation.

Known limitations: compatibility has only been exercised against one DSH Desktop/runtime baseline; system accessibility audit, long-map navigation, and personal 24-hour learning validation remain pending.
